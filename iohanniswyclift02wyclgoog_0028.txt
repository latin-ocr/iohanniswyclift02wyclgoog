lay down that a King must protect his subjects' lives and
property, and since all oppression is an offence against
God as well as man, his doctrine admits of a wider
application than he himself actually gives it. Again
the King is supreme over all human Law, and yet by
virtue os a law os still higher, because divine, authority,
is bound to rule in accordance with it, and may not use
his dispensing power save sor the weightiest reasons.

Once more, in dealing with the KIng's relation to the
National Church‚ if Wyclif does not assign to him the
position of its Supreme Head, the tendency os his
arguments is all in this direction. Whatever is os

The King must see that the Bishops do their work; he
must see moreover that every parish has a true theo·
logian as its priest, and true theology is not the theology
oi the Pope or of the DecretaIS, but a theology which
can justify itself on the basis os ScrIpture. That the
King must be the ultimate judge ol what is scriptural
theology and what is not the De Officio Regis does not
say, but again Wyclil supplies a foundation on which·
subsequent reformers could fairly claim that their own
buildings were erected. In this connexion we may also
note the suggestion that Parliament and a Synod os the
Clergy sitting together should form a court in which
ecclesiastical complaints should be heard, and whose
sanction should be an indispensable preliminary to
excommunication. Os the King’s absolute right to
withdraw all clerical endowments on the ground of the

emergency to use clerical property sor national deleme,
Wyclif has no shadow ol doubt

The approximate date oi the De Officio Regis is not
difficult to fix. Dr. Loserth assigns the Dc Ecclesia to
the autumn and winter of 1378, and everything points
