ingly Wyclis devotcs pp. 166-176 to a detailed consider-
ation os the power of excommunicating and the abuses
attending its exercise. It is shown that excommunication
can only harm a man in so far as he has previously been
harmed by his own sin. Fora real excommunication
there must be a special revelation, and those who

sentences sor pecuniary gain. Such excommunicatione
ought not to be supported by imprisonment, and, with
one of the few touches of humour in the treatise‚ Wyclis
grimly quotes the words oi the layman who told the
excommunicating priest that his medicine was so bad

judged by its usesulness as a handmaid of theology, and
prelates who now exact money from theologians for

permission to study, should be made to contribute to

their support, and no one save a theologian should be
