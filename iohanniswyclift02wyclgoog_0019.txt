as referring to the clergy as the ‘wings of the Church'
this long Chapter cornes to an end.

Chapter Vll (pp. 152·¹9²) is devoted to the exposition
of three laws whose enactment would be for the good
alilre of Church and State:

(ι) that Bishops should be obliged to loolr to the
state of the clergy in their respective moeses

(2) that the King, through his Bishops, should
enforce the residence in all parishes of learned

allow their clergy to live secular lives should be
punished by the confiscation of their revenues, to retain
which they must render good service to the realm.
Such confiscation would be no wrong, for when any
human institution is found to contain error, its founders
or their representatives must correct it (cp. end of Chap
ΙΙΙ, p. 64), and the steady deterioration of the Church
is abundant proof of the error committed in irs endow-
ment.

Of Wyclifs second law the first corollary is that all
comtes native or foreign, must reside in their benefices,
and the country will thus be rid of the curse of foreign

his blasphemous protension to be lord-in·chief of all
benefices, and able to make whatever he decrees lawful.
Wherc curates fail to fulfil their duty the people must
withhold all pay, ancl run the risk of excommunication.
This in the fourteenth century was no light matter, since

forty days after sentence was pronounced the offender,
