xxx INTRODUCTION.

Beneath this in a hand in the fifteenth century is
written: Wn 5, followed by the words: Liber Paul' de
Slawikowics. This Paulus de Slawikowicz is mentioned
in the Monumenta Histor. Universitatis Pragensis I.
300, as having taken his Bachelor's degree at Prague in
1395; his ownership ol the MS. agrees well with its
handwriting, which is that ol the beginning of the
lilteenth century.

From the soregoing description os the two MSS. it
will be seen that MS. 3933 is probably the earlier os the
two, and experiente has shown that itis also the better.
lt has therefore been sreely used to correct the mistakes
os MS. 4514, but the collations at the soot of each page
enable the reader to see at a glance the reading os both
manuscripts wherevcr they differ. lt is needless to say
that Dr. Stange¹s transcriptos MS. 4514 was made with
absolute saithlulness. The Editors have, however, sound
it necessary to completely revise the punctuation, and
they have also thought it well to distinguish proper
names by initial capitale. ln all other respects MS.

4514, as amended by 3933, has been faithfully followed.
