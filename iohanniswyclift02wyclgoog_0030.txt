The De Officio Regis is at present extant in three
manuscripts, viz, Vienna 4514 and 3933, and Prague
X. D. 11. Our text is founded on a transcriptos the
first of these made by Dr. Ο. Stange sor the Wyclif
Society. With this transcript Dr. Hertzberg-Frankel
has collated for the Society MS. Vienna 3933, 3ηά it

is also from his notes that we are able to give the
following description of the two MSS.

MS. Vienna 4514. Quoted as A.

On paper (first and last leaves parchment), small 4to.
Bound in wood covered with leather. On the first leaf
is written: Super Cantica Guntia, and then in a different
writing: Wycleph de blasfemia officio regis. On fol.
86 the copyist of the De Blasphemia has written the
date: circa penthecostes sub a. d. 1432, and signed his
name: Wstrach. The De Officio Rgis occupies ff.
105-182 of the MS„ and is written in a firm and
practised hand of the first half of the fifteenth century, in
the opinion of Dr. Hertzberg-Friinkel identical with that
of the De Blaspheme'a. The De Officiis Regis is pre-
ceded by three leaves, ff. 102-4, containing an alpha-
betical catalogue of Wyclifs works, and followed by an
abridgment of the treatise headed: Sentencia de officio
regis in compendio sic habetur, occupying ff. 183-4.

MS. Vienna 3933. Quoted as Β.

13 double columna, marked in this edition a, b, c, d, for
each leaf, with a division into paragraphs by means of
letters in red inlr in the margin (A, Β, C, eto). The
text is preceded by a table of the contents of the different
chapters, and followed by an alphabetically arranged
index. At the foot of the page there is occasionallya
gloss, apparently in the same hand as the text. On the
inside of the cover at the top of the page a hand of the
second half of the fifteenth century has written:

Versa Berengarium, fuge Wicleff, cede Rikardum,
implicet hic errat, hic sacramenta retractat.
